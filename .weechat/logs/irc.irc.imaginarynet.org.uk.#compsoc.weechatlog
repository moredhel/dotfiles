2013-10-08 23:05:31	hamhut	hey guys, does anyone know how I can set up ssh that I can access publicly?
2013-10-08 23:05:49	hamhut	am trying to set it up using www.no-ip.com
2013-10-08 23:09:21	Reid	On a VPS, your own machine...?
2013-10-08 23:09:22	<--	Withad (~withad@211.50.208.46.dyn.plus.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-10-08 23:12:04	hamhut	am using my own machine... could I use no-ip to get my Ip then ssh through them... this should be possible. it even says that it is finding me. But when I try ssh'ing it times out
2013-10-08 23:12:23	Sunstrike	Got a router between you and the host?
2013-10-08 23:12:31	stesh	hamhut: reverse SSH tunnel
2013-10-08 23:12:32	Reid	Check no-ip permits ssh, check your machine is actually listening on the requisite port, check for any forwarding issues
2013-10-08 23:12:42	Sunstrike	No-IP is just DNS, Reid.
2013-10-08 23:12:48	Sunstrike	Dynamic DNS
2013-10-08 23:12:53	Reid	Sunstrike: Ah, cool. Been forever since I used it.
2013-10-08 23:13:15	Sunstrike	But my guess would be iffy port mapping
2013-10-08 23:13:29	hamhut	yeah, have been using ssh through the uni vpn, but am still having to write down my ip
2013-10-08 23:13:55	Sunstrike	Run the No-IP DUC on the server. Make it keep syncing every hour or two.
2013-10-08 23:14:06	stesh	hamhut: do you another machine you can ssh to?
2013-10-08 23:14:12	stesh	between you and the thing you want to really ssh to?
2013-10-08 23:14:21	stesh	on the machine you want to get to:
2013-10-08 23:14:43	hamhut	I have one laptop in my room that I want to ssh to, then my other laptop I carry around
2013-10-08 23:14:57	Reid	How do you currently ssh to it?
2013-10-08 23:15:07	stesh	ssh -fN -Rsomeport:localhost:22 intermediateip
2013-10-08 23:15:10	stesh	then
2013-10-08 23:15:19	stesh	on the machine with IP address intermediateip
2013-10-08 23:15:23	stesh	ssh localhost -p someport
2013-10-08 23:15:24	hamhut	I connect both of them to the uni vpn then write down the ip
2013-10-08 23:15:32	stesh	done
2013-10-08 23:15:32	Sunstrike	That's overcomplicating the situation a bit.
2013-10-08 23:15:53	Sunstrike	I'm gunna warrant a guess that the IP in DNS isn't matching.
2013-10-08 23:15:55	Reid	Check the one being given to no-ip is the VPN ip, and not the through-the-router ip
2013-10-08 23:16:06	Reid	I'd guess at that being your problem.
2013-10-08 23:16:06	Sunstrike	hamhut; what's your No-IP address? I want to run a dig on it
2013-10-08 23:16:13	hamhut	Reid: yeah, that'll probably be it
2013-10-08 23:16:26	hamhut	hamhut.sytes.net
2013-10-08 23:16:31	hamhut	give it a spin
2013-10-08 23:16:39	Sunstrike	Lemme look at dig then
2013-10-08 23:16:42	stesh	I can get to sshd on that host
2013-10-08 23:16:46	Reid	Can't remember the options no-ip DUC gives you, but check to see if you can choose which network
2013-10-08 23:16:50	Reid	Otherwise, hamachi is your friend
2013-10-08 23:16:54	stesh	$ nc hamhut.sytes.net 22                                                        [23:16]
2013-10-08 23:16:57	Reid	In many, many situations
2013-10-08 23:16:57	stesh	SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.3
2013-10-08 23:17:13	Sunstrike	188.74.85.44
2013-10-08 23:17:15	Sunstrike	?
2013-10-08 23:17:17	hamhut	yep
2013-10-08 23:17:21	hamhut	are you connecting?
2013-10-08 23:18:11	Sunstrike	Not just now but stesh may be
2013-10-08 23:18:18	hamhut	maybe it's my keycom being annoying on outbound connections
2013-10-08 23:18:37	hamhut	ok, but you're pinging the right ip
2013-10-08 23:18:40	stesh	hamhut: it's exposed to the Internet like
2013-10-08 23:18:51	stesh	I can access that from a machine in Dublin :P
2013-10-08 23:19:15	Sunstrike	I'd also recommend running it on a non-standard port.
2013-10-08 23:19:21	Sunstrike	Less likely to get drive-by'd
2013-10-08 23:19:35	stesh	there's a lot you can do to harden it
2013-10-08 23:19:37	Reid	Oh god, fucking keycom
2013-10-08 23:19:47	Sunstrike	Unfamiliar with Keycom.
2013-10-08 23:19:49	hamhut	yeah, I know
2013-10-08 23:19:53	hamhut	I have no idea
2013-10-08 23:20:13	stesh	reverse tunnel is nice in that sense because you at least get the protection of whatever machine you're reverse tunneling through
2013-10-08 23:20:46	stesh	except it's still vulnerable to attack by anyone with local access on that machine
2013-10-08 23:21:00	stesh	(e.g. the school of informatics :P)
2013-10-08 23:21:48	stesh	also, hamhut: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VPN_over_SSH
2013-10-08 23:21:51	hamhut	yeah, not too fussed, might bulk up security in a bit. want a connection first
2013-10-08 23:21:51	stesh	poor man's VPN
2013-10-08 23:22:08	stesh	I don't know how you don't already have a connection though...
2013-10-08 23:22:20	Sunstrike	Have you… cleared your machine's DNS cache?
2013-10-08 23:22:30	stesh	why can't you just go ssh hamhut.sytes.net?
2013-10-08 23:22:41	hamhut	it's not working
2013-10-08 23:22:41	stesh	or ssh 188.74.85.44 to be super sure
2013-10-08 23:22:48	stesh	eh
2013-10-08 23:22:55	Sunstrike	ham, do you have dnstools installed from Pacman?
2013-10-08 23:23:01	hamhut	ssh: connect to host hamhut.sytes.net port 22: No route to host
2013-10-08 23:23:17	hamhut	dunno, looking now... which computer?
2013-10-08 23:23:21	Sunstrike	If not, install it and run `dig hamhut.sytes.net` and tell me the output.
2013-10-08 23:23:44	Sunstrike	Client
2013-10-08 23:24:01	Sunstrike	I believe it's dnstools on Arch that dig is in
2013-10-08 23:24:15	hamhut	hmm, having a look
2013-10-08 23:24:24	hamhut	is that similar in any way to tracepath?
2013-10-08 23:24:29	Sunstrike	No
2013-10-08 23:24:43	Sunstrike	Dig is "DNS Information Groper", it pulls DNS records.
2013-10-08 23:24:49	Sunstrike	Domain not DNS
2013-10-08 23:24:51	Sunstrike	Derp
2013-10-08 23:25:14	hamhut	running it now
2013-10-08 23:25:18	hamhut	connection timed out
2013-10-08 23:25:26	Sunstrike	On the dig command? o.O
2013-10-08 23:25:33	stesh	hamhut: looks awfully like you have no interbutts at all
2013-10-08 23:25:38	stesh	or no DNS at least
2013-10-08 23:25:41	hamhut	yeah...
2013-10-08 23:25:48	stesh	what happens when you try ssh 188.74.85.44?
2013-10-08 23:25:51	Sunstrike	Manually set your DNS servers. How that works depends on your network manager.
2013-10-08 23:26:07	Sunstrike	Google's ones are okay; 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
2013-10-08 23:26:48	hamhut	yeah, probs a good idea, will setup my dns servers.. give me a sec... gotta ask google
2013-10-08 23:26:54	Reid	Google's DNS fuck yeah
2013-10-08 23:27:11	StrawHatter	Why not DuckDuckGo?
2013-10-08 23:27:30	Reid	a) afaik they don't do dns
2013-10-08 23:27:34	Sunstrike	DduckDuckGo is a search engine not DNS, right? Unless they branched out
2013-10-08 23:27:36	stesh	lol
2013-10-08 23:27:40	Reid	b) Google give you jobs
2013-10-08 23:27:46	StrawHatter	I
2013-10-08 23:27:48	Sunstrike	I like B most.
2013-10-08 23:27:49	hamhut	yeah, why not (b) anon
2013-10-08 23:27:52	Reid	c) Google's DNS is fast as merry fuck
2013-10-08 23:28:00	Sunstrike	Google Public DNS is awesome, yes.
2013-10-08 23:28:04	StrawHatter	Thought we were taklking about search enginges
2013-10-08 23:28:06	Reid	Jammy: They's be listening!
2013-10-08 23:28:07	StrawHatter	this is why
2013-10-08 23:28:16	StrawHatter	we should start reading more than the last sentence
2013-10-08 23:28:32	Sunstrike	I committed the Google DNS IPs to muscle-memory since I keep needing them :P
2013-10-08 23:28:36	Reid	Search-engine wise, I like the context that comes from combining search history and browsing habits into the algorithm.
2013-10-08 23:28:41	Reid	Sunstrike: They're also very easy to memorise
2013-10-08 23:28:44	Sunstrike	Yup
2013-10-08 23:29:03	StrawHatter	I like duckduckgo because it has ducks
2013-10-08 23:29:09	StrawHatter	and ducks are kyute
2013-10-08 23:29:22	StrawHatter	not to mention, i can search for porn and shit, and no one will know
2013-10-08 23:29:31	Sunstrike	I can't use Bing or DuckDuckGo since they return crap results for my kinds of searches.
2013-10-08 23:29:41	Sunstrike	Usually for API docs or similar
2013-10-08 23:29:51	StrawHatter	don't get me wrong
2013-10-08 23:29:54	StrawHatter	for important stuff
2013-10-08 23:29:57	StrawHatter	it's god awful
2013-10-08 23:30:04	stesh	you can search google through ddg though
2013-10-08 23:30:05	hamhut	haha, that's kinda true... duckduckgo works well for some things though
2013-10-08 23:30:48	StrawHatter	who went to the social tonight then?
2013-10-08 23:31:16	stesh	I was going to, but I decided I should instead work on coursework
2013-10-08 23:31:21	stesh	so, I went home, and wasted time on IRC instead
2013-10-08 23:31:26	Sunstrike	So figured how to switch DNS ham?
2013-10-08 23:31:43	stesh	hamhut: ssh hamhut@188.74.85.44 
2013-10-08 23:31:44	stesh	what happens
2013-10-08 23:31:44	stesh	pls
2013-10-08 23:31:58	stesh	if it works, then you know it's your DNS 
2013-10-08 23:31:59	StrawHatter	stesh, working at uni is for nerds tho
2013-10-08 23:32:24	hamhut	oh yeah, get a timeout

2013-10-08 23:36:55	Sunstrike	The festival people are fuuun. Atleast the Venues and Companies crew are. The uni guys may get over-protective tho :P
2013-10-08 23:37:07	Reid	True, the non-security people are
2013-10-08 23:37:11	Reid	And the security ones are mostly okay
2013-10-08 23:37:18	Reid	But some like to be too big
2013-10-08 23:37:38	Sunstrike	The Stewards are the really good ones to know. They tend to be very laid back until someone pisses them off royally, which is very rare
2013-10-08 23:37:50	Sunstrike	But they change every year
2013-10-08 23:38:02	Reid	(the suggested response if the incident was repeated, we decided, was to ask where their university of edinburgh card was, and what they thought they were doing in a university of edinburgh building)
2013-10-08 23:38:21	Reid	(essentially parrot them but switch festival for uni of ed)
2013-10-08 23:38:28	Sunstrike	Ahah :P

2013-10-08 23:38:46	StrawHatter	can we pull any pranks of in uni :c
2013-10-08 23:38:52	Reid	You can
2013-10-08 23:38:59	Reid	Just make sure people find it funny.
2013-10-08 23:39:11	StrawHatter	b-but how?
2013-10-08 23:39:15	hamhut1066	Reid: I tried ssh 188.74.85.44, still getting no route to host
2013-10-08 23:39:17	Reid	And it's not too hard to clean up.
2013-10-08 23:39:37	Sunstrike	Ham, you have some serious netderp then :p
2013-10-08 23:40:12	hamhut1066	argh... will keep hacking away at the problem then :p
2013-10-08 23:40:33	stesh	hamhut1066: it's definitely working
2013-10-08 23:40:36	stesh	I can access it

2013-10-08 23:41:57	Sunstrike	ham, can you try `dig @8.8.8.8 hamhut.sytes.net`? What IP does it return?
2013-10-08 23:42:51	hamhut1066	yep, straight on from the dice servers

2013-10-09 00:02:47	stesh	hamhut1066: you could compile a little program to shut it down
2013-10-09 00:02:52	stesh	possibly with loss of data
2013-10-09 00:02:54	stesh	:)

2013-10-09 00:13:18	Reid	Why would we talk about Fight Club?
2013-10-09 00:13:23	Reid	You know the rules.
2013-10-09 00:13:31	StrawHatter	Because Rules 1 and 2 don't apply on IRC
2013-10-09 00:13:31	edran	well

2013-10-09 00:16:07	Reid	Dominoes leaves me very unpleasantly ill the following morning.
2013-10-09 00:16:20	StrawHatter	^
2013-10-09 00:16:23	Reid	I think it's something in their crust.
2013-10-09 00:16:24	StrawHatter	Thank god I'm not the only one
2013-10-09 00:16:35	Reid	Since I can manage a slice or two if I chuck the edge
2013-10-09 00:16:52	Reid	But otherwise, bad times await.
2013-10-09 00:17:06	edran	Any kind of american pizza makes people ill for days. As an Italian, I can only wholehearlty agree. But...
2013-10-09 00:17:08	edran	free food.
2013-10-09 00:17:12	edran	FREE food.
2013-10-09 00:17:14	Reid	And since every other pizza place ever seems not to cause this problem, ~shrug~
2013-10-09 00:17:14	edran	as in beer

2013-10-09 00:19:06	Reid	Magners is possibly the lowest level.
2013-10-09 00:19:11	Reid	StrawHatter: Are you.... tea-total?
2013-10-09 00:19:17	Reid	Or tee-total?
2013-10-09 00:19:24	Reid	Or just yet-to-learn-to-drink?
2013-10-09 00:19:32	StrawHatter	i don't know what that means

2013-10-09 00:22:28	edran	Nah, I know people who are coffe-totaller
2013-10-09 00:22:41	Reid	However, with you earlier mentioning your age, is your teetotalitarianism an informed choice, or merely a "underage and not willing to try?"
2013-10-09 00:22:43	edran	no alcohl & no coffee
2013-10-09 00:23:09	 *	edran doesn't know how to speAl and is appy
2013-10-09 00:23:09	Reid	edran: tea-total is "tee-total, also drinks so much tea. So. Much."

2013-10-09 00:23:52	Reid	Fwiw, shitty beer at high school parties != what decent drinks are like. Also, beer generally is a bit crap. So, y'know, try whisky at some point ;)

2013-10-09 00:24:32	StrawHatter	Nah, I just wanna stay away from all alchols
2013-10-09 00:24:33	hamhut1066	whisky can be good
2013-10-09 00:24:46	hamhut1066	I enjoy red wine too
2013-10-09 00:25:04	Reid	A decent red wine is nice, but crap ones are...blech
2013-10-09 00:25:12	Reid	Though make a reasonable basis for mulled wine
2013-10-09 00:25:56	hamhut1066	yes, and add enough sugar and you've got yourself one hell of a hangover
2013-10-09 00:26:01	Reid	Sugar?
2013-10-09 00:26:02	Reid	SUGAR?

2013-10-09 00:26:24	 *	Reid grumbles something about fools not appreciating good mulled wine
2013-10-09 00:26:28	Reid	I should totally do that this christmas
2013-10-09 00:26:32	hamhut1066	they have tons of crap left over so they add sugar and release to the masses
2013-10-09 00:26:35	Reid	Turn up at a compsoc thing with proper mulled wine
2013-10-09 00:26:42	Reid	Oh gods

2013-10-09 00:26:49	hamhut1066	haha, good for parties :p
2013-10-09 00:27:14	hamhut1066	but yeah... it's a bad choice every time... because they make lots of wine there
2013-10-09 00:27:25	hamhut1066	winelands and all that
2013-10-09 00:27:46	Reid	Thing is, some SA wine is lovely
2013-10-09 00:28:35	hamhut1066	yeah, not gonna lie, they make good wine, but it's like anything. take the tea business in Kenya, the Kenyans get the shit tea. all the good stuff is exported

2013-10-09 00:29:16	StrawHatter	guys
2013-10-09 00:29:18	Reid	Although
2013-10-09 00:29:19	Reid	Not all
2013-10-09 00:29:30	Reid	If you have money, it's the cheapest way to get good stuff. Be near the source.
2013-10-09 00:29:42	StrawHatter	what number of lectures of which i missed is considered a bad number?
2013-10-09 00:29:45	Reid	Like good single malts here are shit cheap compared to anywhere else.
2013-10-09 00:29:49	Reid	StrawHatter: Varies wildly by course
2013-10-09 00:29:56	StrawHatter	Reid, Industrial Management?
2013-10-09 00:30:11	Reid	Some courses, don't bother with the lectures, they will make you dumber. Others, miss more than one and oh god no.
2013-10-09 00:30:18	Reid	Dunno. Not Informatics.
2013-10-09 00:30:37	Reid	Also, dunno for most Informatics ones now either, since various lecturers changed.
2013-10-09 00:30:37	hamhut1066	yeah, that's true
2013-10-09 00:30:39	StrawHatter	This is why, I'd like people to actually tell me what an outside course it :/
2013-10-09 00:30:49	StrawHatter	is*
2013-10-09 00:30:55	Reid	Outside course = course from outside your chosen school
2013-10-09 00:31:09	Reid	So if you're studying informatics, a course from outside the school of informatics
2013-10-09 00:31:12	StrawHatter	I only just found out I had to take one
2013-10-09 00:31:13	StrawHatter	Like
2013-10-09 00:31:13	hamhut1066	ie. I am doing Philosophy of Science
2013-10-09 00:31:18	StrawHatter	4 weeks afterwards
2013-10-09 00:31:21	hamhut1066	and studying Computer Science
2013-10-09 00:31:26	Reid	You are under no obligation to take an outside course on CS/SE
2013-10-09 00:31:34	Reid	You have a slot where you must choose a course
2013-10-09 00:31:43	Reid	But you can pick ones within Informatics if any are available
2013-10-09 00:31:58	Reid	Protip: Take Logic 1 in semester 2, you cover most of it in Computation and Logic
2013-10-09 00:32:00	StrawHatter	hamhut, you an undergrad by any chance?
2013-10-09 00:32:08	edran	StrawHatter: Really? What did your PT tell you?
2013-10-09 00:32:25	edran	hamhut1066 is a first year like you probably
2013-10-09 00:32:30	edran	I took PhilSci last year
2013-10-09 00:32:32	Reid	Also, that's something that should've come up at your initial DoS meeting when you matriculated.
2013-10-09 00:32:36	StrawHatter	edran, she like mentioned it briefly, and then i was like "i don't even know what that is"
2013-10-09 00:32:49	StrawHatter	and then we moved on from the topic
2013-10-09 00:33:15	hamhut1066	yeah, have just started... had to have a break between school and uni
2013-10-09 00:33:28	edran	StrawHatter: can you pm me who she is? I'm the School Rep and I'd like to give this kind of feedback to the Directors of teaching
2013-10-09 00:33:38	StrawHatter	You're kidding right?
2013-10-09 00:33:55	edran	Me?
2013-10-09 00:33:57	edran	No.
2013-10-09 00:33:58	StrawHatter	@edran*

2013-10-09 00:34:04	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-09 00:34:08	StrawHatter	are you sure?
2013-10-09 00:34:12	StrawHatter	it's really not a big deal
2013-10-09 00:34:15	Reid	They won't jump down her throat
2013-10-09 00:34:32	edran	;)
2013-10-09 00:34:36	edran	Don't worry
2013-10-09 00:34:39	Reid	But if it becomes a recurring thing, they'll remind PTs that they really should inform students about that sort of thing
2013-10-09 00:34:42	StrawHatter	<Reid> They won't jump down her throat
2013-10-09 00:34:50	StrawHatter	i actually giggled i swear to god
2013-10-09 00:34:56	edran	Fair enough
2013-10-09 00:34:58	Reid	Have you never heard that expression before? o.O
2013-10-09 00:34:59	edran	anyways, don't worry
2013-10-09 00:35:22	StrawHatter	Reid, nope
2013-10-09 00:35:27	Reid	Huh.
2013-10-09 00:35:31	Reid	But...you are Scottish.
2013-10-09 00:35:36	Reid	Does not compute
2013-10-09 00:35:45	StrawHatter	:c
2013-10-09 00:35:49	StrawHatter	I'm a bad Scot
2013-10-09 00:35:50	StrawHatter	I'm sorry

2013-10-09 00:40:42	StrawHatter	accept the fact that lambda doesn't like us
2013-10-09 00:40:48	edran	bulls
2013-10-09 00:40:49	StrawHatter	</3
2013-10-09 00:40:58	Reid	It has a simple operation thing
2013-10-09 00:41:01	edran	On #haskell is fantastic
2013-10-09 00:41:03	Reid	That I can't remember
2013-10-09 00:41:09	Reid	edran: It's the same commands here
2013-10-09 00:41:24	edran	Reid: I know. I just haven't used it in a while
2013-10-09 00:41:29	StrawHatter	oh yeah
2013-10-09 00:41:29	Reid	Ah
2013-10-09 00:41:31	StrawHatter	do we
2013-10-09 00:41:37	StrawHatter	still do haskell in year 2?
2013-10-09 00:41:40	Reid	No
2013-10-09 00:41:48	StrawHatter	<333
2013-10-09 00:41:52	Reid	Just in FP
2013-10-09 00:41:59	Reid	But learn to love it, it shows up again in other places
2013-10-09 00:42:29	StrawHatter	I've tried loving it like how I tried to love the Street Fighter franchise
2013-10-09 00:42:38	StrawHatter	She just could never love me back
2013-10-09 00:42:41	edran	There are some 3rd and 4th year that can let you use it
2013-10-09 00:42:45	edran	*courses
2013-10-09 00:43:05	edran	Well, FP makes you hate everything else
2013-10-09 00:43:17	edran	So brace yourself
2013-10-09 00:44:20	StrawHatter	i just remembered i've got a tutorial thingy for thursday
2013-10-09 00:44:25	hamhut1066	it's so much shorter than everything else
2013-10-09 00:44:28	StrawHatter	i can already feel the despair
2013-10-09 00:44:41	hamhut1066	yeah, I've started on next weeks... it's my procrastination tool
2013-10-09 00:44:53	StrawHatter	fuck
2013-10-09 00:44:56	Reid	The worst thing is
2013-10-09 00:44:57	StrawHatter	i'm such a bad student
2013-10-09 00:44:59	Reid	You don't have Wadler.
2013-10-09 00:45:05	StrawHatter	Wadler?
2013-10-09 00:45:05	Reid	No jumping up and down to emphasis points.
2013-10-09 00:45:08	Reid	No Lambdaman.
2013-10-09 00:45:12	Reid	Poor firsties :(
2013-10-09 00:45:15	Reid	Phil Wadler
2013-10-09 00:45:15	StrawHatter	Oh!
2013-10-09 00:45:18	StrawHatter	Is this the -
2013-10-09 00:45:23	StrawHatter	He's my Tutor for it!
2013-10-09 00:45:29	hamhut1066	my maths is death though
2013-10-09 00:45:30	Reid	The reason lambdabot is often referred to as wadlerbot
2013-10-09 00:45:43	hamhut1066	oh, I can't remember the name of mine
2013-10-09 00:45:45	Reid	He lectured FP until the year before last
2013-10-09 00:45:48	Reid	Was on sabbatical last year
2013-10-09 00:46:00	StrawHatter	I remember him being Phil and that he was a previous lectuere
2013-10-09 00:46:12	StrawHatter	No but
2013-10-09 00:46:13	StrawHatter	The Don
2013-10-09 00:46:16	StrawHatter	Is amazing
2013-10-09 00:46:16	Reid	He's one of the inventors of Haskell
2013-10-09 00:46:31	StrawHatter	... Oh snap, really?
2013-10-09 00:46:59	Reid	And concluded the lambda calculus lecture by ripping open his shirt to reveal the lambdaman costume, with the line "So remember... ~rip~ lamda calculus!"
2013-10-09 00:47:02	Reid	Yes.
2013-10-09 00:47:14	Reid	(and it's a Superman costume with a lambda instead of an S)
2013-10-09 00:47:19	StrawHatter	PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE BEING SERIOUS
2013-10-09 00:47:21	StrawHatter	I SWEAR TO GOD
2013-10-09 00:47:26	StrawHatter	THIS IS AMAZING
2013-10-09 00:47:43	StrawHatter	HOW-
2013-10-09 00:47:44	StrawHatter	I JUST-
2013-10-09 00:47:51	StrawHatter	DON BETTER DO THIS OR I SWEAR TO GOD
2013-10-09 00:48:12	Reid	Highlight of that lecture
2013-10-09 00:48:32	Reid	Oh fuck, he did it at QCon
2013-10-09 00:48:38	edran	Reid, tell them the big picture tho
2013-10-09 00:48:41	StrawHatter	>he did it at a Con

2013-10-09 00:49:23	lambdabot	Title: Lambda Man - YouTube
2013-10-09 00:49:38	edran	Don is not too bad. Wadler is a mmm... an interesting guy. If you love Haskell, you'll love him, but otherwise you may come to hate him.
2013-10-09 00:49:48	Reid	http://bodil.org/hipster/m/lambda-man.jpg
2013-10-09 00:49:56	 *	Reid doesn't know Don
2013-10-09 00:50:02	Reid	Wadler really REALLY knows his stuff
2013-10-09 00:50:09	StrawHatter	what if i said
2013-10-09 00:50:16	StrawHatter	i don't like Haskell
2013-10-09 00:50:17	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-09 00:50:18	StrawHatter	right
2013-10-09 00:50:25	StrawHatter	i should really read before i type
2013-10-09 00:50:26	Reid	There's a level of kool aid offering, and if you drink it he's great
2013-10-09 00:50:27	edran	Don too. I think he partially designed ML, so he should not be too bad :)
2013-10-09 00:50:48	edran	ha
2013-10-09 00:51:16	edran	Well, I do like Wadler, but I heard people saying completely the opposite.
2013-10-09 00:51:27	edran	While generally Don is loved by everyone :P
2013-10-09 00:51:37	edran	at least last year it was that way
2013-10-09 00:52:03	Reid	Wadler is hated by two classes of people
2013-10-09 00:52:23	Reid	1) People who get cross about being forced to work hard
2013-10-09 00:52:35	Reid	2) People who actively dislike functional programming
2013-10-09 00:52:49	StrawHatter	...
2013-10-09 00:53:03	StrawHatter	How on Earth do I fill both categories
2013-10-09 00:53:44	Reid	With magic
2013-10-09 00:53:56	Reid	There are things you will learn to love about FP, and things you will learn to hate
2013-10-09 00:53:59	StrawHatter	A-Am I a wizard yet?
2013-10-09 00:54:22	Reid	An obvious example of the latter - there are SO MANY INSTANCES where you want to use 2 or 3 lines of code with an internal variable. No can do.
2013-10-09 00:54:53	Reid	An obvious example of the former - anything you learn to do with list comprehension. You will cry at its absence in other langauges in the fullness of time.
2013-10-09 00:55:01	Reid	languages*
2013-10-09 00:55:04	StrawHatter	shhhhhhhhhhh
2013-10-09 00:55:08	StrawHatter	i just
2013-10-09 00:55:19	StrawHatter	won't even attempt to make lists viable <3
2013-10-09 00:55:30	Reid	You won't see uses for them now
2013-10-09 00:55:32	Reid	But you will in time
2013-10-09 00:55:34	Reid	Trust me.
2013-10-09 00:56:13	Reid	There have been a number of situations where I've wished I could do a single line list comprehension, and been forced to write several lines and use a helper function
2013-10-09 00:56:48	StrawHatter	i'm waiting for the day
2013-10-09 00:56:59	Reid	Everything you write in haskell that should be written in haskell (some tasks you're given should not be written in haskell) is beautiful, consise code
2013-10-09 00:57:03	StrawHatter	when functional programming becomes what it like, needs to be
2013-10-09 00:57:14	Reid	concise*
2013-10-09 00:57:19	Reid	In the real world, it is
2013-10-09 00:57:35	Reid	Its main usage is in mass data crunching, which is what it's perfect for.
2013-10-09 00:57:35	StrawHatter	it is? 
2013-10-09 00:57:37	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-09 00:58:06	Reid	Uni does the artificial environment of handing you things you shouldn't do in FP to do in FP
2013-10-09 00:58:37	StrawHatter	speaking of uni, i'm guessing it's not a bad idea to drop out at the end of semester 1 right? :D
2013-10-09 01:00:01	Reid	.....

2013-10-09 01:00:29	StrawHatter	i meant uni in general
2013-10-09 01:03:43	Reid	hamhut1066: Yes. Though frustrating when you get marks for putting a screw in with a hammer.
2013-10-09 01:04:15	Reid	StrawHatter: If you genuinely feel it's not working out, talk to your PT. Dropping out isn't something you should just go "eh, fuck it" about.
2013-10-09 01:04:34	Norgg	Reid: AT is great because when you're in AT you don't need to look at AT.

2013-10-09 01:04:53	Reid	Norgg: I was talking about the coffee on upper floors
2013-10-09 01:05:23	Norgg	Free coffee is pretty standard for doing software because caffiene intake is roughly proportional to code output.
2013-10-09 01:05:58	Reid	And how it's nice to work there because of the free coffee being decent
2013-10-09 01:07:00	StrawHatter	Norgg, is that an actual fact?
2013-10-09 01:07:22	Norgg	Definitely and also I haven't just got back from drinking beers.
2013-10-09 01:07:30	Reid	Did you Computer?
2013-10-09 01:07:40	Norgg	Am in Cambridge, sort of computered.
2013-10-09 01:07:50	Reid	Oooh
2013-10-09 01:07:51	Norgg	Said goodbye to an increpare.
2013-10-09 01:07:55	Reid	Cambridge
2013-10-09 01:07:57	Reid	Fancy :D
2013-10-09 01:08:19	Norgg	Will be back in Edinburgh in ~6 months.
2013-10-09 01:08:31	Reid	That's a while to be down there
2013-10-09 01:08:39	Reid	Won't <insert company name here> miss you?
2013-10-09 01:08:48	Reid	Or are you job upgrading?
2013-10-09 01:08:52	Norgg	I've been down here for like 2 years, still work for the company on AT6 though.
2013-10-09 01:08:58	Norgg	It's complicated. :P
2013-10-09 01:09:16	Reid	That'll be why you only occasionally appear around then :P
2013-10-09 01:09:22	Norgg	Yep. :D
2013-10-09 01:09:24	Reid	Reckon you'll make Conpulsion this year?
2013-10-09 01:10:03	Norgg	Hopefully! It's about when we're moving back.
2013-10-09 01:10:08	Reid	:D
2013-10-09 01:10:21	Norgg	2 kids to bring along now.
2013-10-09 01:10:22	Reid	T'will be a bit later than usual this year - last weekend in April
2013-10-09 01:10:32	Reid	And so they shall become one of us
2013-10-09 01:11:14	Norgg	Either that or I'll drive them mad and they'll totally rebel from everything geeky, could go either way really.
2013-10-09 01:11:27	Reid	Early indoctrination is the safest ploy
2013-10-09 01:11:33	StrawHatter	^
2013-10-09 01:11:38	Reid	Otherwise they might end up being professional athletes or something
2013-10-09 01:13:56	Norgg	I would be pretty down with that.
2013-10-09 01:14:25	hamhut1066	Reid: agreed, but am still learning the syntax. we're only getting into higher order functions now
2013-10-09 01:15:18	Reid	Norgg: Woe is you. Your children shall either be true geeks, or popular people ;)
2013-10-09 01:15:29	Reid	hamhut1066: You'll learn to love (chunks of) it :D
2013-10-09 01:15:31	hamhut1066	my system is back up, took long enough... damn systemd update

2013-10-09 01:17:05	hamhut1066	at least you get plugs in the train
2013-10-09 01:17:07	Norgg	I will be jumped on by a 4 year old in ~5 hours.
2013-10-09 01:17:07	Reid	StrawHatter: Are you an attractive female who likes geeky things? If so, perhaps.
2013-10-09 01:17:20	Reid	Norgg: Most effective alarm clock you'll ever possess.

2013-10-09 01:19:19	StrawHatter	Eugh
2013-10-09 01:19:32	StrawHatter	that sounded like it could work for some reason
2013-10-09 01:19:45	StrawHatter	but to answer your question, no, i'm not a grill
2013-10-09 01:20:01	Reid	I'd be worried if you were a George Foreman
2013-10-09 01:20:17	Reid	Impressed, admittedly, but worried about the imminent takeover.

2013-10-09 14:44:32	Jammy	but it's not necessarily stupid
2013-10-09 14:44:43	Jammy	if you define 100% to be an acceptable level of effort for example
2013-10-09 14:44:57	Jammy	then giving an exceptional level of effort would be more than 100%
2013-10-09 14:45:40	Jammy	percentages above 100 are relatively common in pretty much any situation where percentages are used
2013-10-09 14:47:47	Reid	Not when discussing usage of things with maxima
2013-10-09 14:47:55	Reid	So "100% effort" is "all possible effort"
2013-10-09 14:48:05	Reid	"an increase of >100%" is fine
2013-10-09 15:06:00	cronin101	But then you'd have to rank students against the diety of effort giving, the one man who gave more than all others
2013-10-09 15:06:02	cronin101	Also
2013-10-09 15:06:06	cronin101	I got 130% in NAT
2013-10-09 15:06:29	cronin101	(coursework)
2013-10-09 15:06:44	cronin101	But that's because M. Herrman is a pretty cool guy
2013-10-09 15:07:28	cronin101	also, wish me luck
2013-10-09 15:07:33	cronin101	I have to give a presentation to DK Arvind
2013-10-09 15:07:46	cronin101	Not even the wonders of Keynote can prepare me for this
2013-10-09 15:08:42	stesh	https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS
2013-10-09 15:08:48	stesh	well, nothing could possibly go wrong with this
2013-10-09 15:11:29	Jammy	Reid: But the the informatics marking system for coursework makes even less sense than that
2013-10-09 15:11:39	Jammy	in that 70% is if you do everything that's asked of you
2013-10-09 15:11:46	Jammy	and 100% is some abstract thing more
2013-10-09 15:11:52	Reid	cronin101: Cry.
2013-10-09 15:12:03	Reid	I'd try and offer advice, but DK.
2013-10-09 15:12:06	Jammy	it's a lot easier to pick up marks in the 0-70% range than the 70-100% range
2013-10-09 15:12:41	Jammy	saying that 100% is getting everything that was asked of you done would be much better
2013-10-09 15:12:50	Jammy	and more than 100% if you go above and beyond
2013-10-09 15:13:56	Jammy	and whenever I hear the "Giving it 110% thing", I take that to mean that you're doing more than would usually be expected
2013-10-09 15:14:42	Jammy	if 100% is the normal amount of work/effort and a job is particularly important (the sitations where you are told to give 110%), then you'd be putting more work or effort in than what is normally 100%
2013-10-09 15:14:54	Jammy	they don't day 110% of your maximum
2013-10-09 15:15:05	Jammy	say*
2013-10-09 15:17:34	Reid	Thing is, the only people who use phrases like "give 110%" are the ones who normally ask for staff to "give their all" or "give 100%/110%" on the average day. Or they're quoting corporate buzzwords
2013-10-09 15:18:08	Jammy	maybe 100% is the average amount of effort given in that sector?
2013-10-09 15:19:00	Jammy	blanket rules of "nothing more than 100%!" are great for making sure 6 year olds aren't confused, but most people grow out of them eventually
2013-10-09 15:22:43	Jammy	on an unrelated note, Firefox OS seems pretty cool
2013-10-09 15:22:48	Jammy	from my first impressions
2013-10-09 15:22:54	Jammy	although the ZTE open is SLOW
2013-10-09 15:22:57	hamhut1066	have you installed it?
2013-10-09 15:23:02	hamhut1066	mobile os?
2013-10-09 15:23:30	Jammy	I'm gonna play around with it a bit
2013-10-09 15:23:42	Jammy	so I got one of the phones
2013-10-09 15:23:46	Jammy	they're like £60
2013-10-09 15:25:11	hamhut1066	cool, sounds Like it could be fun
2013-10-09 15:26:11	Jammy	gonna build images with all of the default apps replaced by my own versions
2013-10-09 15:26:23	Jammy	a calculator that is always off-by-1
2013-10-09 15:54:13	cronin101	If the calendar event is your anniversary with your wife, it forgets to remind you
2013-10-09 15:55:09	cronin101	If it detects your wife operating your phone, it flashes a notification saying 'Sexy Kate just signed in'

2013-10-10 10:36:21	StrawHatter	That reminds me, is it bad if I've already missed 3 of my math tests online?
2013-10-10 10:36:49	Jammy	they have online math tests now?
2013-10-10 10:36:59	Jammy	also, I guess that depends on how it works exactly
2013-10-10 10:37:12	Jammy	when I were a lad, there were 10 maths courseworks
2013-10-10 10:37:17	StrawHatter	W-Woah
2013-10-10 10:37:20	Jammy	and your mark was based on the best 8
2013-10-10 10:37:29	Jammy	so you could miss 2 and still get 100%
2013-10-10 10:37:36	StrawHatter	That sounds pretty darn neat
2013-10-10 10:38:00	Jammy	and you only needed 40%
2013-10-10 10:38:06	Jammy	so you could get away with doing 4
2013-10-10 10:38:29	Jammy	and the maths department whined at informatics constantly about how nobody was doing the coursework
2013-10-10 10:38:34	StrawHatter	Bahahha
2013-10-10 10:38:38	StrawHatter	That's priceless!
2013-10-10 10:38:57	Jammy	I seem to remember the response to that was just "Maybe if the coursework was worth more than 10% of the course, they'd do it"
2013-10-10 10:39:40	StrawHatter	I thought we just had tests, we have to do coursework? Like a project?
2013-10-10 10:40:05	Jammy	it's an entirely different course now :)
2013-10-10 10:40:27	StrawHatter	:
2013-10-10 10:40:27	Jammy	but it was basically just an exercise sheet every week
